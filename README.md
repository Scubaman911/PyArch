# PyArch
Mostly Pythonic Stack

## Project Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python package and environment management.

## Docker Quickstart

See the ./fastapi_app README for greater detail, but the quickest way to get started from the root project directory "Pyarch" is to run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Assuming you have docker, docker-compose and poetry.
